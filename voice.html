<p>I have a pocket mod for my vocal warm-up phrases. A pocket mod has 6
(interior) pages, so I picked 18 phrases (I wanted each phrase to show
up twice), shuffled them, and then arranged them on each of the pages.
Duplicates on a given page were swapped with the first
would-be-non-duplicate on the next. The final results were:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Phrase</th>
<th>First Page</th>
<th>Second Page</th>
<th>Third Page</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>By and large</td>
<td>Pretty frequently</td>
<td>That tracks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>That tracks</td>
<td>Sounds good</td>
<td>Must learn, act, then take his ease</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Fair enough</td>
<td>Who would know aught of art</td>
<td>Say more</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>For what it&#39;s worth</td>
<td>Let&#39;s not overthink this</td>
<td>Sounds good</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Thank you</td>
<td>Fair enough</td>
<td>For what it&#39;s worth</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>I&#39;m more than happy to</td>
<td>I&#39;m more than happy to</td>
<td>Hi, how are you?</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>On the days when I use these warm-up phrases as part of my vocal
exercises, I roll 12 d6s. The first d6 (I put them in arbitrary order)
determines the page for that day, and each of the dozen is used to
determine which phrase I read from that page. I read each phrase twice,
unless consecutive d6s have the same value, in which case I read the
phrase twice for the first die, then an extra time for each subsequent
(to reduce tedium).</p>
<p>In this way, I am able to randomize my voice training, which saves
executive function and serves to introduce variety into my learning.</p>
