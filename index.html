<h1>about</h1><p>I&#39;m hecate. Mostly, I do video games. Some of that is knowledge
representation, some of that is contextual dialogue, and the other some
of that is programming languages for game development.</p>
<p>I care about automated validation, constraint solving in game
applications; and, again, programming languages for game development.</p>
<p>I do a lot of yoga, and I have a decent number of plants.</p>
<p>I try not to overthink things.</p>
