<ul>
<li><p>boils down to thinking critically</p></li>
<li><p>what does “good” even mean?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>this isn’t just navel-gazing, or dodging the question: i genuinely
think most people stop at the absolute minimum for good and go no
further… if you think about it for even a second, you end up with
something pretty useful, and then you can move on to the next steps</p>
<p>Take something simple, like board games. Many people would define
being good at board games as, “you win more than most people, and you
can beat people who are also good.” But, the thing is that “winning at
the game” is ipso facto being good at the game, this definition is
tautological. Furthermore, it isn’t remotely prescriptive: if you tell a
neophyte board gamer to “try to win,” they’ll swiftly drop from your
tutelage. So, again, what does being good look like? For any given game,
it probably means being able to come up with a strategy that’s robust to
opponents trying to do the same, and some degree of flexibility to
switch strategies, and a little bit of luck (in the form of being poised
to take advantage of opportunities). So, it’s about analysis. What do
the mechanics of the game <em>encourage</em> you to do as the player?
How can you minimize bad outcomes when things don’t go your way, and how
can you maximize your advantage when they do?</p>
<p>While this Board Game Winner’s Framework doesn’t do much to teach you
how to be a master chess player, for instance, it does teach you how, if
you will, be good at being good at chess. Your questions to other chess
players stop being, “how do I win?” and start being, “how do I make XXX
opening less risky?” You start looking at your winning games as being
more or less good than others (did you scrape out a victory? was it a
crushing defeat? how did your strategy solidify over the course of the
game?). Ditto with your losses: a narrow loss is still a drop in Elo,
but <em>you</em> know that you’ve improved when your friend who used to
clown on you starts to break a sweat in order to get checkmate.</p>
<p>There’s an increased granularity that comes from coming up with even
an okay answer to, “what does good mean?” You ask better questions, you
feel better about yourself, you’re more able to evaluate your
progress.</p>
<ul>
<li>what does “good” mean to you?
<ul>
<li>again, don’t overthink this: just write down a couple of goals for
yourself</li>
<li>also, sit down and think about which aspects of a “good
practitioner” matter most to you: do you want to be a good training
partner? do you want to make new players feel welcome? do you want to
have a flashy, impressive style? do you want to be fast and
prolific?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>do the thing you usually do, perfectly</li>
<li>do something completely different than you usually do</li>
<li>do something under tight constraints (time crunch, left-handed, legs
only, etc.)</li>
<li>look at practice footage and review your performance</li>
