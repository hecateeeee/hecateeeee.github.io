<p>I try not to overthink things.</p>
<p>I care about automated validation, constraint solving in game
applications, and programming languages for game development.</p>
<p>We can and should use tooling improvements to take the grunt work off of
the shoulders of devs. Unit testing, automated linting, bots that crawl
over source code and apply systematic improvements, etc. We made the
computers good at that kind of stuff for a reason.</p>

<li>It doesn&#39;t matter what style choices you make as long as everyone is
making the same ones (preferably automatically).</li>
