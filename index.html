<h1>about</h1><p>I&#39;m hex. Mostly, I do video games. Some of that is knowledge
representation, some of that is contextual dialogue, and the other some
of that is programming languages for game development.</p>
<p>I do a lot of yoga, and I have a decent number of plants.</p>
<p>I try not to overthink things.</p>
<h1>&quot;&quot;professional&quot;&quot; opinions</h1><p>I care about automated validation, constraint solving in game
applications; and, again, programming languages for game development.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a theme here: I firmly believe that we can and should use
tooling improvements to take the grunt work off of the shoulders of
devs. Unit testing, automated linting, bots that crawl over source code
and apply systematic improvements, etc. We made the computers good at
that kind of stuff for a reason.</p>

<li>It doesn&#39;t matter what style choices you make as long as everyone is
making the same ones (preferably automatically).</li>
