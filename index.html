<p>I’m hex. I’m a game developer. Strictly, I’m a software engineer who
specializes in character AI, but I always say that game programming,
especially when characters are involved, is at least one third design
work (games are, after all, complete ontologies of our own
construction).</p>

<p>I currently work for a AAA startup called That’s No Moon. Before
that, I did a <em>lot</em> of different things at Naughty Dog (more on
that elsewhere), though my official title was “Senior AI Engineer.” And
even before that, I did AI, UI, and general gameplay work for a strategy
simulation indie studio back in Chicago called SomaSim.</p>
