<h1 class="title">I Reach for Simple Tools</h1>
</header>
<p>I used to build my website using a nifty little javascript tool
called <a href="https://github.com/sintaxi/harp">Harp</a>. Before that,
I used the very popular ruby tool <a
href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Before that, and interspersed
through, I used a smattering of other things of which I have little
specific memory. Now, I use the dead simple combination of the
ever-present <code>make</code> in combination with everyone’s favorite
document converter, <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>. My shift,
gradual over the course of the last ten years, has been from fancy tools
to simple ones.</p>
<p>I pick simple tools because they don’t bring ecosystems with them.
Installing Harp meant installing <code>npm</code>. Installing
<code>npm</code> meant installing NodeJS. I didn’t use NodeJS. (I still
don’t.) I knew that it’s a wildly popular ecosystem, and that when
people started writing servers in the same langauge with which they were
writing site semantics, it was revolutionary. But that revolution didn’t
help me, since I was just trying to generate static sites made of text
and, occasionally, images. Similarly, installing Jekyll meant installing
Ruby, and, I vaguely remember, installing some tools for Ruby
environment management. Maybe I didn’t need such tools.
(Retrospectively, I’m sure I could have gotten away with being a little
naughty.) But I didn’t have the relevant expertise to have an opinion
about Ruby set up. So I did a bunch of work to learn the basics of
something unfamiliar.</p>
<p>This is the first problem with using a new, fancy tool to do
something simple. I need to do a lot of work just to stop having a blank
canvas, to go from having nothing to having something. Using any tool
has some prerequisites, but fancier tools have more of them, and how
much overhead those prerequisites add is a function of how much the
would be user already knows about the ecosystem. In a hypothetical world
where I hacked regularly in Javascript, I don’t think I’d even consider
“install NodeJS” as a meaningful step. Indeed, I’d likely have done it
long before trying to install Harp. Maybe this hypothetical version of
myself is writing a mirror post espousing Harp for its elegance and ease
of use. She’s probably writing and thinking with an audience of fellow
Javascript wizrds in mind.</p>
<p>The real version of myself, however, got culture shock visiting a
strange land. If, perhaps, I had picked a tool written in C# (or Scheme,
or C++, or even Python), I would have had an easier time with the first
step. But the other problem is that fancy tools always tempt me to do
fancy things. If what you want to do is simple, then time spent being
fancy is time wasted. Jekyll had really cool metadata features, and I
spent time futzing with those. Harp supports <a
href="https://github.com/dscape/jade">Jade</a>, which rules. I liked
learning it. You should check it out if you want to use a cool,
templating language. But you shouldn’t check it out if what you want to
do is write. Because using metadata features and banging out clever
templates isn’t scribing words to put on the internet for people to
read. Neither involves taking thoughts on a subject and phrasing them in
a new way, to expand thinking or make them accessible to other people.
So, I drop the cool features, and keep just writing. My tools don’t even
suggest doing something else.</p>
<p>Our tools shape us. They should do exactly what you want them to, and
not anything else. They should encourage you to do what you want to do,
and not anything else. I want to write, and I want my tools to encourage
me to write. If you want to write, your best bet is to crack open your
editor of choice and start tapping. Then find a way to make it look
presentable. You can find basic templates or roll your own tolerable CSS
file in a few minutes. Then find a way to put it on the internet. I use
github pages. Then find a way to ask other people to read it. Don’t
waste too much time on any of the other features, like templating
languages or cool metadata. They’re fancy tools that want you to get
good at using them.</p>
<p>You can be pretty dogwater at using simple tools and still get a lot
of typing done. If what you want is simple, try not to overthink it. Get
to writing.</p>
<p>As always, email your thoughts to hello [at] hecate [dot]
computer.</p>
