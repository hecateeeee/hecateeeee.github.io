<p>One way of looking at a makefile is as a tool for executing a series of
steps to build the contents of a directory. A better way is to look at
is as a way to programmatically anyalyze the desired <em>artifacts</em> that a
build process produces, and then the relevant substeps for constructing
each artifact, and <em>then</em> executing those steps. (This inversion,
switching from &quot;what steps do I execute?&quot; to &quot;what artifacts do I want
to produce?&quot; is drawn from <a href="https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch18.html#artifact-based_build_systems">Artifact-Based Build
Systems</a>,
a section in Software Engineering at Google (an excellent read).)</p>
